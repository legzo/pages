# A few personal experimentations

Â 

## [Dojo MÃ¶lkky](https://github.com/legzo/dojo-molkky)

*#kotlin #dojo #youtube*

The rules of MÃ¶lkky implemented in Kotlin - this projects was built during [a series of 7 youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLX3k_dCSBA49TfOPFwg7iqqxFvyTsP-H-) I made during the Covid-19 lockdown for the members of my team. The goal was to discover a few of the features of the Kotlin language through a fun dojo.

## [Advent of Code](https://github.com/legzo/advent-of-code-2018)

*#kotlin*

I really enjoy the challenges from the yearly Advent of Code. I solved almost a half of the 2018 puzzles as well as some from 2019. It was an opportunity for me to try to write as idiomatic Kotlin code as possible. I also used some of the challenges for coding dojos with my team.

## [k-wheels](https://github.com/legzo/k-wheels)

*#kotlin #ktor #strava-api #concurrency*

I love cycling and I record my routes with Strava. But with a free account the analysis possibilities are a bit restricted on Strava. So I built an API that calls Strava API, and uses a local nosql database to store data and run analysis on it. It is deployed on Heroku and [you can for example see the kilometers I made each months of 2019](https://k-wheels.herokuapp.com/activities/commute/2019). In order to respect quotas and to be efficient while fetching data from Strava, I used coroutines to parallelize back-end API calls.

## [processing-stuff](https://github.com/legzo/processing-stuff)

*#processing #typescript*

I really enjoy [Daniel Shiffman's youtube videos](https://www.youtube.com/c/TheCodingTrain). I completed his MOOC ["The Nature of Code" on Kadenze](https://www.kadenze.com/courses/the-nature-of-code-ii/info). And here are a few experiments I made using p5.js (processing ported to js) and typescript instead of js.
